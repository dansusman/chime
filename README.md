A simple macOS menu bar app that plays a chime every hour, on the hour.

> :warning: _Disclaimer: This is a WIP, recreational app that I don't really intend to do anything with. I just like [Grila](https://lowtechguys.com/grila/)'s hourly chime feature but don't find myself using that app's calendar much._

# TODO
1. Customizable sounds
2. Don't require opening the menu bar item to start the timer.
